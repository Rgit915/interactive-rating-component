## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** – for structured, semantic markup
- **CSS** – for styling and layout
- **Mobile-first workflow** – focusing on responsive design for optimal performance on mobile devices

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to dynamically update and manage UI elements, creating a more interactive and responsive user experience.


### Continued Development

I plan to continue developing this project by exploring more complex interactions and state management with JavaScript, such as using event delegation and creating reusable functions.
